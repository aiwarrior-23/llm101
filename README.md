# LLM for All — 1. Building Your Own GPT

This project demonstrates how to build a custom ChatGPT interface using OpenAI APIs, LangChain, and Llama Index. It covers creating backend APIs with Flask and FastAPI, connecting a React-based frontend for a user-friendly chat interface, and configuring settings directly from the UI for flexibility.

## Project Highlights

1. **OpenAI API**: Basic ChatGPT setup using OpenAI’s model.
2. **LangChain Integration**: Incorporates LangChain for enhanced functionality.
3. **Llama Index Integration**: Leverages Llama Index to build an alternative GPT-based solution.
4. **UI Integration**: Connects the models to a React frontend via APIs for real-time interaction.

This repository provides a foundational setup for building, configuring, and deploying your own GPT-powered chat solution.
